Hello Servlet
Servlet is a technology/API/class that is used to handle requests in web applications and it resides on server side. Spring Boot uses Servlet to receive requests from client side.

There are two ways in Spring Boot to use Servlet Api:

Use @ServletComponentScan annotation.
Use @Bean annotation.

Hello Servlet Example Prep
